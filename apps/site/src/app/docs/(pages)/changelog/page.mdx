## July 2024 - v3.7 release

This release focuses on improving the dashboard load times and login processes.

* From now on, all authentication data is encrypted and then stored within a secure browser cookie, instead of in our database. Since we don't need to go back and forth between the database and the browser, this will make the dashboard load a lot faster.
e, then immediately revoked afterwards.

* Login sessions now last for 7 days (was previously 24 hours).

* There's
* You can once again login to the dashboard via Discord OAuth2. This time, since the switch to relying on cookies, access/refresh tokens are only used once to verify your identity and create your cooki a new pretty loading spinner :3
