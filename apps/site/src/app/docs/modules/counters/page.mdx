Counters allow you to dynamically showcase your server statistics within your channel names. Whether you want to highlight the total number of members, track online activity, or monitor other key metrics, Counters give you the flexibility to present this data in a visually appealing and easily accessible manner.

## Variables

Variables are a type of placeholder that you can use in various module configurations that are later swapped out for their actual values. For example, if you wanted to display the number of members in your server, you could use the `{memberCount}` variable.

Currently, this module supports the following variables:

<ModuleVariables moduleId={ModuleId.Counters} />

If you have any ideas for new variables, please let us know in our [Discord server](https://phasebot.xyz/redirect/discord)!

## How to Set Up Counters

#### Step 1: Create a New Voice Channel

Create a new voice channel in your server and place it in a visible location, such as the top of the channel list. Then, lock the channel to prevent members from joining and talking in it.

#### Step 2: Configure the Module

Go to the dashboard and add the module via **Manage Mode**. Then, go back to **Edit Mode** and click on the module card to open the config modal.

#### Step 3: Save Your Changes

Once configured, exit the modal and press the **Save changes** button. Counters are updated every 10 minutes, so it might take a short while for your changes to appear.
