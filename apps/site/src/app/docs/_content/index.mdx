Phase is a free to use, open source Discord bot built by <UserHoverCard username="@notcharliee" avatar="https://github.com/notcharliee.png" bio="non-binary monster addict that codes things" joined="February 2022" url="https://github.com/notcharliee" />. It aims to be the all-in-one solution for as many servers as possible, with a large variety of different modules and commands.

Whether you're seeking to enhance a small server shared with friends or overseeing a bustling community, Phase is your solution for effectively managing, moderating, and improving your Discord experience.

## Why should you use Phase?

While popular bots like MEE6 or Dyno have their strengths, they lack transparency, tend to lock their best features behind <strong>ridiculously</strong> priced paywalls, and rarely add user-requested features. That's why I made Phase!
