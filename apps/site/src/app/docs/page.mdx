## FAQ

  <AccordionItem value="item-1">
    <AccordionTrigger>How is Phase free?</AccordionTrigger>
    <AccordionContent>
      The bot is hosted on [Railway](https://railway.app), which has a very generous Hobby tier, so keeping it free is as simple as keeping it cheap to run. The code is optimised for running on low resources, so it doesn't cost much.
