Counters allow you to dynamically showcase your server statistics within your channel names. Whether you want to highlight the total number of members, track online activity, or monitor other key metrics, Counters give you the flexibility to present this data in a visually appealing and easily accessible manner.

## Variables

Variables are a type of placeholder that you can use in various module configurations that are later swapped out for their actual values. For example, if you wanted to display the number of members in your server, you could use the `{memberCount}` variable.

Currently, this module supports the following variables:

<ModuleVariables moduleId={ModuleId.Counters} />
